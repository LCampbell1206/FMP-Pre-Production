**Game Concept**
A simple 2D Platformer, where there the player controls parts of the level, rather than the character.
The aim of the game is to keep the character alive as long as possible.
(Currently undecided if the aim is to beat a level, or to reach a high score)

**Controls**
*Either :-
- A simple slime humanoid inspired by the graffiti seen on London trains. This would make the landscape of the game a city, with either an industrial or cyber-punk theme.
- A fae/elemental sprite, that will change based on pickups. These pick-ups do not change the functions of the characters
